# Basic Node Routing Project

The project aims at using Node.js to establish a routing system linked to different html files

This project is made using the **http** and **fs** module

The **http** module is used to make a server and to listen to and respond to requests on the client side

The **fs** module is used to navigate files, read and write files, modify the file system etc.
